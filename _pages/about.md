My full name is Le Nhut Nam (Vietnamese format). I am a junior student who majoring in Computer Science at the VNU-HCM, University of Science. 

My fields of interest are Data Science and Computer Vision especially in Digital Image & Video processing. Currently, I'm focusing on research Graph Theory, Graph Convolution Neural Networks. 

Besides that, I also learn some new technologies by watching Youtube, reading articles, etc. I have a good knowledge about C/C++, Python 3. 

Aside from that, I also know basics concept in Java, but I do not use it much, but it is a mandatory programming language in my curriculum so I can review it quickly for working purposes. My foreign language skill is not quite excellent at all but I think I have a good skill at reading & listing. I like to making friends and drink coffee.

This website is powered by **[fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages)** [^1] and its content can be written in English or Vietnamese depend on me. I just want to share what I learned, found and researched during my working. I hope these articles can be someone who gets stuck in the field which I am researching. ^^!
