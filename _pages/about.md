My full name is **Le Nhut Nam** (Vietnamese format). I am a junior student who majoring in **Computer Science** at the VNU-HCM, **University of Science**. 

<p><img style="float: right;margin:5px 20px 5px 1px" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/khtn.png" width="200px"></p>

My fields of interest are Data Science and Computer Vision especially in Digital Image & Video processing. Currently, I'm focusing on research **Graph Theory**, **Graph Convolution Neural Networks** and **Complex Networks**.

Besides that, I also learn some new technologies by watching Youtube, reading articles, etc. I have a good knowledge about C/C++, Python 3. I also like PyTorch, it the library for deep learning that I like to use for doing projects at my university.

Aside from that, I also know basics concept in Java, but I do not use it much, but it is a mandatory programming language in my curriculum so I can review it quickly for working purposes. My foreign language skill is not quite excellent at all but I think I have a good skill at reading & listing. I like to making friends and drink coffee.

I'm a pretty quiet person, I seldom play sports such soccer, badminton or something like that. But I like to play chess and watching anime (Japan Anime), read some light novel in my spare time. Because I'm just a normal person in this world, so I have many many weak point, but I have a strong point, it's hard work, I think if I work hard, with every task assigned, any problem I come across, I can solve it well, and as fast as possible.

I just want to share what I learned, found and researched during my working. I hope these articles can be someone who gets stuck in the field which I am researching. ^^!
